A list of projects I want to cultivate, in some cases after learning a new programming language and/or technology.
Additionally, a To-do list for projects I am working on or will soon begin.

**To-Do List**

 - Blog/Portfolio site with HTML/CSS and JavaScript

**Personal Fun Projects**

 - 2D Python RP or adventure game using pygame experimenting with tiles, scrolling, and various mechanics, design, and some simple AI.
 - Art project combining some styled artistic background images with family photos, and add some embedded musical elements.  Possibly a secure site, a standalone program, or perhaps a sort of video presentation/slideshow.
 - A game, website, or program related to one of the sports teams that I follow such as the New York Yankees, Portland Trail Blazers, or Pittsburgh Penguins.
